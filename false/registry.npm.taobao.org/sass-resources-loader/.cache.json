loader will `@import` your SASS resources into every `required` SASS module. So you can use your shared variables & mixins across all SASS styles without manually importing them in each file. Made to work with CSS Modules!\n\nNote, this loader is not limited to SASS resources. It supposedly works with less, post-css, etc. per [issue 31](https://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader/issues/31).\n\n-------\n\nIf you're using this project and you like it, please give us a star!

We want to make sure you're aware of it!\n\n### Testimonials\nFrom Joel Hooks, Co-Founder, Chief Nerd at [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/), January 30, 2017:\n![2017-01-30_11-33-59](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1118459/22443635/b3549fb4-e6e3-11e6-8ea2-6f589dc93ed3.png)\n\nFor more testimonials, see [Live Projects](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/blob/master/PROJECTS.md) and [Kudos](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/blob/master/KUDOS.md).\n\n---------------\n\n## Installation\n\nGet it via npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install sass-resources-loader\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate your file (or files) with resources:\n\n```scss\n/* resources.scss */\n\n$section-width: 700px;\n\n@mixin section-mixin {\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  width: $section-width;\n}\n```\n\n**NB!**\n* Do not include anything that will be actually rendered in CSS, because it will be added to every imported SASS file.\n* Avoid using SASS `@import` rules inside resources files as it slows down incremental builds. Add imported files directly in `sassResources` array in webpack config instead.\n\nApply loader in webpack config (`v1.x.x` & `v2.x.x` are supported) and provide path to the file with resources:\n\n```js\n/* Webpack@2: webpack.config.js */\n\nmodule: {\n  rules: [\n    // Apply loader\n    {\n      test: /\\.scss$/,\n      use: [\n        'style-loader',\n        'css-loader',\n        'postcss-loader',\n        'sass-loader',\n        {\n          loader: 'sass-resources-loader',\n          options: {\n            // Provide path to the file with resources\n            resources: './path/to/resources.scss',\n\n            // Or array of paths\n            resources: ['./path/to/vars.scss', './path/to/mixins.scss']\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n},\n\n/* Webpack@1: webpack.config.js */\n\nmodule: {\n  loaders: [\n    // Apply loader\n    { test: /\\.scss$/, loader: 'style!css!sass!sass-resources' },\n  ],\n},\n\n// Provide path to the file with resources\nsassResources: './path/to/resources.scss',\n\n// Or array of paths\nsassResources: ['./path/to/vars.scss', './path/to/mixins.scss'],\n```\n\n> NOTE: If `webpackConfig.context` is not defined, `process.cwd()` will be used to resolve files with resource.\n\nNow you can use these resources without manually importing them:\n\n```scss\n/* component.scss */\n\n.section {\n  @include section-mixin; // <--- `section-mixin` is defined here\n}\n```\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport css from './component.scss';\n\n// ...\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <div className={css.section} />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Glob pattern matching\nYou can specify glob patterns to match your all of your files in the same directory.\n```js\n// Specify a single path\nresources: './path/to/resources/**/*.scss', // will match all files in folder and subdirectories\n// or an array of paths\nresources: [ './path/to/resources/**/*.scss', './path/to/another/**/*.scss' ]\n```\n\nNote that `sass-resources-loader` will resolve your files in order. If you want your variables to be accessed across all of your mixins you should specify them in first place.\n```js\nresources: [ './path/to/variables/vars.scss', './path/to/mixins/**/*.scss' ]\n```\n\n## Contributing\nThis project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nSee [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n\n## License\nMIT.\n\n## Example and Related Libraries\n\n* [react-webpack-rails-tutorial](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/), live example at [www.reactrails.com](http://www.reactrails.com/).\n* [bootstrap-loader](https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-loader/)\n\n*Identical to top of page*\n\n## Thank you from Justin Gordon and [ShakaCode](http://www.shakacode.com)\n\n* **Video:** [Front-End Sadness to Happiness: The React on Rails Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGkTvKRPYrk): History, motivations, philosophy, and overview.\n* *[Click here for talk slides](http://www.shakacode.com/talks).*\n\nWe at [ShakaCode](http://www.shakacode.com) are a small, boutique, remote-first application development company.
